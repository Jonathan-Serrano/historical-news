      "[\"Search results\\nFeb 7, 2025\\nSeries: Simulation-Based Inferece\\nSeries: Simulation-Based Inferece\\nContents\\nModel misspecification is a critical challenge in simulation-based inference (SBI), particularly in neural SBI, where methods rely on simulated data to train neural networks. These methods often assume that simulators accurately represent the true data-generating process, but in practice, this assumption is frequently violated. Such discrepancies can result in observed data that are out-of-distribution relative to the simulations, leading to biased posterior distributions and unreliable inferences. This blog reviews recent work on model misspecification in SBI, discussing its definitions, methods for detection and mitigation, and open challenges. The aim is to emphasize the importance of developing robust SBI methods that can accommodate the complexities of real-world applications.\\nIntroduction\\nSimulation-based inference (SBI)\\nprovides a powerful framework for applying Bayesian inference to study complex systems\\nwhere direct likelihood computation is infeasible\\n[\\nCra20F\\n]\\n. By\\nusing simulated data to approximate posterior distributions, SBI has found applications\\nacross diverse scientific fields, including neuroscience, physics, climate science and\\nepidemiology\\n[\\nGon20T\\n,\\nBre20S\\n,\\nWat21M\\n,\\nWit20S\\n]\\n. However, these methods often\\nassume that the simulator is a faithful representation of the true data-generating\\nprocess. In practice, this assumption is frequently violated, leading to model\\nmisspecification. In this blog post, we provide an overview of the currently available\\napproaches to detect and mitigate model misspecification in SBI, and discuss open\\nchallenges.\\nIn standard Bayesian inference, model misspecification can lead to biased or misleading\\nposterior estimates. However, in\\nneural\\nSBI, the problem is particularly severe\\nbecause the posterior or likelihood is approximated using neural networks trained on\\nsimulated data. Neural networks are known to produce arbitrarily incorrect predictions\\nwhen probed with out-of-distribution (OOD) data\\n[\\nSze14I\\n]\\n,\\nand in a misspecified simulator, the observed data $\\\\mathbf{x}_o$ is effectively OOD\\nrelative to the training distribution. This can lead to highly unreliable posterior\\nestimates, distorted uncertainty quantification, and incorrect scientific conclusions.\\nAn illustrative example of model misspecification has been provided by Ward et al.\\n(2022)\\n[\\nWar22R\\n]\\nusing a simplified version of the Susceptible,\\nInfected, Recovered (SIR) modelt that is commonly used in epidemiology. This simulator\\nestimates key parameters such as the infection rate $\\\\beta$ and recovery rate $\\\\gamma$,\\nwith observations summarized by metrics like the maximum number of infections, timing of\\npeak infection, and autocorrelation. In this setting, misspecification is introduced\\nthrough a delay in weekend infection counts, with cases shifted to the following Monday.\\nThis subtle mismatch between real and simulated data structures can lead to biased\\nposterior estimates and unreliable uncertainty quantification in neural SBI\\n[\\nWar22R\\n,\\nCan22I\\n]\\n.\\nThe sensitivity of neural networks to OOD data underscores the importance of robust\\ndiagnostics and addressing model misspecification is crucial for ensuring the\\nreliability of SBI in real-world applications. Below, we comment on the definition\\nof model misspecification in the context of SBI, reviews recent methods to detect and\\nmitigate its effects, and outlines open challenges for future research.\\nDefining Model Misspecication\\nModel misspecification occurs when the assumptions of the model do not align with the\\ntrue data-generating process, leading to unreliable inferences. In Bayesian inference,\\nthis problem arises when the true data-generating process cannot be captured within the\\nfamily of distributions defined by the model. Walker (2013) provides a foundational\\ndefinition\\n[\\nWal13B\\n]\\n:\\nA statistical model $p(\\\\mathbf{x}_s | \\\\theta)$ that relates a parameter of interest\\n$\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta$ to a conditional distribution over simulated observations\\n$\\\\mathbf{x}_s$ is said to be misspecified if the true data-generating process\\n$p(\\\\mathbf{x}_o)$ of the real observations $\\\\mathbf{x}_o \\\\sim p(\\\\mathbf{x}_o)$ does not\\nbelong to the family of distributions ${p(\\\\mathbf{x}_s | \\\\theta); \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta}$.\\nThis structural definition provides a theoretical basis for understanding model\\nmisspecification but does not fully address its practical implications in SBI workflows.\\nModel Misspecification in SBI\\nSBI is particularly sensitive to model misspecification because the model is defined\\nthrough a simulator, and inference relies entirely on simulator-generated data. Unlike\\nclassical Bayesian inference, where the likelihood function is explicit, simulators in\\nSBI may introduce subtle discrepancies that propagate through the inference pipeline,\\nresulting in biased posterior estimates.\\nModel Misspecification in Approximate Bayesian Computation\\nThe issue of model misspecification in SBI was first systematically addressed by Frazier\\net al. (2020)\\n[\\nFra19M\\n]\\nin the context of Approximate Bayesian\\nComputation (ABC,\\n[\\nSis18H\\n]\\n). General approach of ABC is to\\nobtain approximate posterior samples by comparing simulated and observed data using a\\ndistance metric and accepting only those parameters that generate simulation very close\\nto the observed data. When the data is high-dimensional, it is common to use\\nhand-crafted or learned summary statistics. However, under misspecification, the\\nposterior in ABC does not concentrate on the true parameters but instead on “pseudotrue”\\nparameters that minimize discrepancies between simulated and observed summary\\nstatistics. This leads to biased posteriors and unreliable credible intervals. The\\nchoice of summary statistics is central to this problem, as they determine how well\\nsimulated data align with observed data. While foundational for understanding\\nmisspecification, ABC’s reliance on handcrafted summary statistics limits its relevance\\nto neural SBI methods, which use neural networks for feature extraction.\\nModel Misspecification in Neural SBI\\nNeural SBI methods eliminate the need for manually chosen summary statistics by using\\nneural networks to approximate posterior distributions (or likelihoods or likelihood\\nratios) based on simulations. A popular neural SBI method is neural posterior estimation\\n(NPE,\\n[\\nPap16F\\n]\\n), where a neural network is used to\\nlearn a parametric approximation of the posterior distribution (e.g., a mixture of\\nGaussians, a normalizing flow, or a diffusion model) using simulated data. However, this\\nflexibility introduces new vulnerabilities. Neural networks trained on simulations can\\nfail catastrophically when applied to observed data that lie outside the training\\ndistribution. This issue has been systematically studied by Cannon et al. (2022) in the\\ncontext of neural SBI\\n[\\nCan22I\\n]\\n.\\nHowever, before we dive into the methods to mitigate misspecification in SBI, let us\\nnote that there are at least three different sources of inaccuaries in the neural SBI\\nworkflow:\\nMisspecification of the Simulator:\\nThe true data-generating process does not\\nbelong to the family of distributions induced by the simulator. This corresponds to\\nthe classical Bayesian notion of misspecification described by Walker (2013). For\\nexample, if a simulator lacks the capacity to model key features of the observed\\ndata, the resulting posterior may fail to capture the true parameter values\\naccurately.\\nMisspecification of the Prior\\n: Misspecification can also occur when the prior\\nused in the inference process does not incorporate the “true parameter” underlying\\nthe data-generating process. Prior mismatch can distort posterior estimates, leading\\nto inferences that reflect artifacts of the assumed prior rather than the true\\nunderlying process.\\nErrors in the Inference Procedure\\n: Even if the simulator and prior are correctly\\nspecified, the inference algorithm itself may introduce errors, such as\\nsystematically biased posteriors or uncalibrated uncertainty estimates, e.g., due\\nto underfitting or overfitting during neural-network training.\\nThe third case reflects a general challenge in neural SBI. Efforts to address these\\nissues include calibration tests such as simulation-based calibration\\n[\\nTal20V\\n]\\n, expected coverage diagnostics\\n[\\nDei22T\\n,\\nMil21T\\n]\\n, and classifier-based calibration\\ntests\\n[\\nZha21D\\n,\\nLin24L\\n]\\n. These tools focus on\\nvalidating posterior accuracy and uncertainty quantification, and are usually assuming\\nthat prior and the simulator are well-specified.\\nThe second case of prior misspecification is a general challenge in the Bayesian\\ninference and can be addressed with standard Bayesian workflow tools like prior\\npredictive checks\\n[\\nGel20B\\n]\\n. Therefore, it has received less\\nattention in the SBI specific literature, with only brief discussions in works like\\nWehenkel & Gamella et al. (2023)\\n[\\nWeh24A\\n]\\n.\\nThus, the primary focus of most work on model misspecification in the SBI literature is\\nthe first case, with the aim of detecting and mitigating simulator-related\\nmisspecification. In the remainder of this post, we will give an overview of these\\napproaches.\\nAddressing Model Misspecification\\nRecent works have introduced a range of methods to address model misspecification in\\nsimulation-based inference (SBI). These approaches can be broadly categorized into four\\nstrategies: learning explicit mismatch models, detecting misspecification through\\nlearned summary statistics, learning misspecification-robust statistics, and aligning\\nsimulated and observed data using optimal transport. Each method has unique strengths\\nand limitations, which we summarize below.\\nLearning Explicit Misspecification Models\\nFigure 1\\n(adapted from\\n[\\nWar22R\\n]\\n):\\nVisualization of the robust neural posterior estimation (RNPE) framework.\\nWard et al. (2022)\\n[\\nWar22R\\n]\\npropose\\nRobust Neural Posterior\\nEstimation (RNPE)\\n, an extension of Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), to address\\nmisspecification by explicitly modeling discrepancies between observed and simulated\\ndata. RNPE introduces an error model, $p(\\\\mathbf{y} | \\\\mathbf{x})$, where\\n$\\\\mathbf{y}$ represents observed data and $\\\\mathbf{x}$ simulated data. This error model\\ncaptures mismatches, enabling the “denoising” of observed data into latent variables\\n$\\\\mathbf{x}$ that are consistent with the simulator\\n(Figure 1)\\n.\\nThe method trains a standard NPE on simulated data while enabling its application to\\npotentially misspecified observed data through a denoising step. This is achieved by\\ncombining a marginal density model $q(\\\\mathbf{x})$ trained on simulated data with the\\nexplicitly assumed error model $p(\\\\mathbf{y} | \\\\mathbf{x})$. The error model is\\nparametrized and trained alongside the NPE density estimator. Using Monte Carlo\\nsampling, the denoised latent variables $\\\\mathbf{x}_m \\\\sim p(\\\\mathbf{x} | \\\\mathbf{y})$\\nare obtained and used to approximate the posterior $p(\\\\theta | \\\\mathbf{x}_m)$.\\nThe results presented in\\n[\\nWar22R\\n]\\ndemonstrate that RNPE\\nenables misspecification-robust NPE across three benchmarking tasks and an intractable\\nexample application. By explicitly modeling the error for each data dimension, the\\napproach also facilitates model criticism, allowing practitioners to identify features\\nin the data that are more likely to be misspecified. However, the method relies on\\nselecting an appropriate error model, such as the “spike-and-slab” model, which may not\\ngeneralize to all misspecification scenarios. Furthermore, the approach is\\ncomputationally intensive, requiring additional inference steps, and is most effective\\nin low-dimensional data spaces.\\nDetecting Misspecification with Learned Summary Statistics\\nFigure 2\\n(adapted from\\n[\\nSch24D\\n]\\n):\\nSimulated data is used to train a neural network to map into a latent space designed to\\ndetect misspecification. At inference time, the observed data is embedded mapped into\\nthe latent space to detect misspecification.\\nSchmitt et al. (2024)\\n[\\nSch24D\\n]\\nfocus on\\ndetecting\\nmisspecification using learned summary statistics. Their method employs a summary\\nnetwork, $h_\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x})$, to encode both observed and simulated data into a\\nstructured summary space, typically following a multivariate Gaussian distribution\\n(Figure 2)\\n. Discrepancies between distributions in this space are quantified\\nusing metrics like Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), with significant divergences\\nindicating misspecification.\\nThe training procedure for this approach remains the same as in standard neural SBI\\nmethods except for an additional MMD term in the NPE loss function:\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\phi, \\\\psi} = \\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{inference}}(\\\\phi) + \\\\lambda \\\\cdot\\n\\\\text{MMD}^2[p(h_{\\\\psi}(\\\\mathbf{x})), \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{0}, \\\\mathbb{I})].\\n$$\\nIntuitively, the additional MMD loss term encourages the embedding network to obtain a\\nGaussian structure in the latent summary space, while not directly affecting the quality\\nof the posterior estimation ensured by the standard NPE loss\\n[\\nSch24D\\n]\\n. At inference time, the learned embedding network can then\\nused to detect misspecification for unseen, e.g., observed, data points.\\nThis approach is adaptable to diverse data types and does not require explicit knowledge\\nof the true data-generating process. Additionally, it is amortized, i.e., it can be\\napplied to new observed data without re-training because the training does not depend on\\n$x_o$. However, its performance depends on the design of the summary network and the\\nchoice of divergence metric. While effective for detecting misspecification, it does not\\ndirectly correct for it, instead providing insights for iterative simulator refinement.\\nLearning Misspecification-Robust Summary Statistics\\nHuang & Bharti et al. (2023)\\n[\\nHua23L\\n]\\npropose a method for\\nlearning summary statistics that are both informative about parameters and robust to\\nmisspecification. Their approach is similar to the detection approach above in that it\\nextends the standard NPE loss with an MMD term. However, this term directly takes into\\naccount the embedded observed data and balances robustness to misspecification with\\ninformativeness\\n[\\nHua23L\\n]\\n:\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{inference}} + \\\\lambda \\\\cdot\\n\\\\text{MMD}^2[h_{\\\\psi}(\\\\mathbf{x}_s), h_{\\\\psi}(\\\\mathbf{x}_o)].\\n$$\\nHere, $h_\\\\psi$ represents the summary network, $\\\\mathbf{x}_{s}$ and $\\\\mathbf{x}_{o}$\\nare simulated and observed data, respectively, and $\\\\lambda$ controls the trade-off\\nbetween inference accuracy and robustness. Unlike the detection method above, this\\napproach directly adjusts the summary network during training to mitigate the impact of\\nmisspecification on posterior estimation.\\nBenchmarking results presented in Huang & Bharti et al. (2023) demonstrate improved\\nperformance compared to the RNPE approach, with the additional advantage of\\napplicability to high-dimensional data. However, the method has several limitations. The\\nmodified loss function introduces additional complexity, and its success depends on\\nselecting appropriate divergence metrics and regularization parameters, which often\\nrequire domain-specific tuning. Additionally, the learned embedding is tailored to a\\nspecific $x_o$ so that the method its ability to\\namortize\\nover different observations.\\nFurthermore, because robustness is implicitly learned during training and operates in\\nthe latent space, there is limited direct control over how and where misspecification is\\nmitigated.\\nAddressing Misspecification with Optimal Transport\\nFigure 3\\n(adapted from\\n[\\nWeh24A\\n]\\n): Visualization of ROPE; the top line shows the standard\\nNPE approach of learning an embedding network and a posterior estimator. Additionally, a\\ncalibration set is used to fine-tune the embedding network for embedding observed\\nreal-world data, and to learn an optimal transport mapping. At inference time, the OT\\nmapping is used to obtain a misspecification-robust posterior estimate as a weighted sum\\nof NPE posteriors.\\nWehenkel & Gamella et al. (2024)\\n[\\nWeh24A\\n]\\npropose a method\\ncalled ROPE that combines Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) with optimal transport (OT)\\nto address model misspecification. Their approach is designed for specific scenarios\\nwhere a calibration set of real-world observations and their corresponding ground-truth\\nparameter values is available. For instance, this may occur in expensive real-world\\nexperiments where ground-truth parameters can be measured, while a cheaper but\\nmisspecified simulator models only parts of the underlying processes. The calibration\\nset is used to learn an optimal transport map $T$ that aligns simulated and observed\\ndata distributions.\\nThe method begins by applying standard NPE to the simulated (misspecified) data to train\\nan embedding network $h_\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x}_s)$ and a posterior estimator $q(\\\\theta |\\n\\\\mathbf{x}_s)$. Next, the embedding network is fine-tuned on the labeled calibration\\nset, resulting in a modified embedding network $h_\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_o)$ tailored to the\\nobserved data. This fine-tuned network ensures that embeddings for observed data align\\nbetter with those for simulated data\\n(Figure 3)\\n.\\nAt inference time, a transport map $T$ is learned using OT, aligning the distributions\\nof embedded simulated data $h_\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x}_s)$ and observed data\\n$h_\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_o)$. The resulting transport matrix $P^\\\\star$ is then used to compute\\na mixture model for the desired real-world data posterior:\\n$$\\n\\\\tilde{p}(\\\\theta | \\\\mathbf{x}_o) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N_s} \\\\alpha_{ij} q(\\\\theta | \\\\mathbf{x}_s^j),\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\alpha_{ij} = N_o P^\\\\star_{ij}$, $N_o$ is the size of the calibration set, and\\n$\\\\mathbf{x}_s^j$ are $N_s$ simulated samples generated by running the simulator on prior\\nparameters $\\\\theta_j \\\\sim p(\\\\theta)$. The weights $\\\\alpha_{ij}$ from the OT solution\\ncombine the posteriors $p(\\\\theta | \\\\mathbf{x}_s^j)$, providing a robust posterior\\nestimate for the observed data $\\\\mathbf{x}_o$.\\nAn interesting property of this approach is that as $N_s$, the number of simulated\\nsamples, grows, the mixture posterior $\\\\tilde{p}(\\\\theta | \\\\mathbf{x}_o)$ approaches the\\nprior $p(\\\\theta)$. This underconfidence property provides a mechanism to ensure that\\nposterior estimates remain conservative and avoid overconfidence in the presence of\\nsevere misspecification. However, this effect introduces a trade-off: while increasing\\n$N_s$ improves robustness to misspecification, it also reduces the informativeness of\\nthe posterior, potentially leading to overly broad parameter estimates. Selecting $N_s$\\nappropriately is therefore crucial, as it balances reliability and uncertainty\\nquantification against the ability to extract meaningful parameter constraints (see\\n[\\nWeh24A\\n]\\nfor heuristics).\\nWhile conceptually elegant and flexible, this method relies on access to calibration\\ndata—observed data with known ground-truth parameters—which may not be available in\\nfields like cosmology or neuroscience. This reliance on calibration data limits its\\napplicability to specific use cases.\\nSummary of Approaches\\nThe methods discussed above tackle different facets of model misspecification in SBI,\\nranging from explicit error modeling to the development of robust summary statistics and\\nthe alignment of simulated and observed data distributions. While each approach\\ndemonstrates unique strengths, their applicability varies depending on the specific\\nmisspecification scenario, computational complexity, and the availability of calibration\\ndata.\\nHowever, the diversity of definitions, notations, and evaluation settings across these\\nworks highlights the need for a unified framework to define and compare methods.\\nSimilarly, the varying hyperparameter choices, methodological complexity, and absence of\\nstandardized benchmarks make it challenging for practitioners to navigate and apply\\nthese approaches effectively. These gaps motivate the need for better methods, common\\ndefinitions, accessible benchmarks, and practical user guides, as we outline below.\\nOpen Challenges\\nThe recent works outlined above have made significant progress in addressing model\\nmisspecification in simulation-based inference (SBI), introducing methods for detecting\\nand mitigating its effects. However, the problem of model misspecification in SBI is far\\nfrom being fully resolved. While these methods offer valuable insights and tools, we\\nhighlight key challenges that need to be addressed to further advance the field:\\nBetter Methods for Detecting and Addressing Model Misspecification:\\nWhile recent\\nmethods have improved our ability to diagnose and mitigate model misspecification,\\nsignificant limitations remain. Many current techniques focus on specific aspects of\\nmisspecification, such as identifying discrepancies in summary statistics or aligning\\ndata distributions via optimal transport. However, these approaches often require\\nadditional modeling assumptions, computational overhead, or prior knowledge about the\\nnature of the misspecification. A key challenge is to develop more flexible and\\nscalable methods that can:\\nDetect misspecification in a principled and data-driven manner, without relying on\\npredefined summary statistics or manual tuning.\\nProvide interpretable diagnostics that help practitioners understand the sources\\nand consequences of misspecification in their models.\\nOffer robust mitigation strategies that work across different types of\\nmisspecification, without requiring large amounts of additional data or\\ncomputationally expensive corrections.\\nA Common and Precise Definition of Model Misspecification in SBI:\\nAs highlighted\\nin this post, model misspecification in SBI can arise from different sources,\\nincluding mismatches between the simulator and the true data-generating process,\\nprior misspecification, and errors introduced by the inference procedure itself. A\\ncommon and formally precise definition of these different cases is essential for\\nunifying the field. Such a framework would provide clarity for researchers and\\npractitioners, enabling a more systematic comparison of methods and their\\napplicability to specific types of model misspecification.\\nCommon Benchmarking Tasks for Evaluating Methods:\\nAnother obstacle to progress in\\naddressing model misspecification is the lack of an established set of benchmarking\\ntasks tailored to the different cases of model misspecification. While current\\nevaluations often focus on specific scenarios or datasets, limiting the\\ngeneralizability of conclusions, there are promising developments. For instance,\\nWehenkel & Gamella et al.\\n[\\nWeh24A\\n]\\nre-used\\ntasks proposed by Ward et al.\\n[\\nWar22R\\n]\\nand introduced\\nseveral new tasks designed to probe different aspects of model misspecification.\\nThese efforts provide a valuable starting point, but they need to be integrated into\\na common benchmarking framework and made accessible through an open-source software\\nplatform. Such a framework would enable researchers to rigorously test new methods\\nunder a variety of realistic model misspecification conditions, facilitating fair\\ncomparisons and encouraging the development of approaches robust across diverse\\nsettings.\\nPractical Guidelines for Detecting and Addressing Model Misspecification:\\nFor SBI\\nto be widely adopted in practice, there is a need for clear guidelines or a\\npractitioner’s guide on how to detect and address model misspecification, e.g.,\\nsimilar to a Bayesian workflow as introduced in\\n[\\nGel20B\\n]\\n.\\nSuch a guide should include recommendations for diagnosing model misspecification\\nusing available tools, selecting appropriate mitigation methods, and interpreting\\nposterior results under potential misspecification. This would help bridge the gap\\nbetween theoretical advancements and real-world applications, ensuring that\\npractitioners can confidently apply SBI methods in the presence of model\\nmisspecification.\\nAddressing these challenges will pave the way for more robust and practical SBI methods\\ncapable of handling model misspecification effectively. A unified framework, rigorous\\nbenchmarks, and practical guidelines will not only advance research on model\\nmisspecification but also simplify its handling in applied settings. Together, these\\nefforts will strengthen SBI as a reliable tool for scientific inference in complex and\\nrealistic scenarios.\\nReferences\\n[Cra20F]\\nThe frontier of simulation-based inference\\n,\\nKyle Cranmer, Johann Brehmer, Gilles Louppe.\\nDec\\n2020\\nMany domains of science have developed complex simulations to describe phenomena of interest.

In reinforcement learning, however, recent studies have shown that modern model-based agents display poor adaptivity to such changes. The main reason for this is that modern agents are typically designed to improve sample efficiency in single task settings and thus do not take into account the challenges that can arise in other settings. In local adaptation settings, one particularly important challenge is in quickly building and maintaining a sufficiently accurate model after a local change. This is challenging for deep model-based agents as their models and replay buffers are monolithic structures lacking distribution shift handling capabilities. In this study, we show that the conceptually simple idea of partial models can allow deep model-based agents to overcome this challenge and thus allow for building locally adaptive model-based agents. By modeling the different parts of the state space through different models, the agent can not only maintain a model that is accurate across the state space, but it can also quickly adapt it in the presence of a local change in the environment.
