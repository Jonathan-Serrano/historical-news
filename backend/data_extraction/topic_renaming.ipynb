         "Paris/London/Atlanta: Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia president Charles Plosser, who votes on policy this year, said recent encouraging economic data isn’t enough to change the pace of the central bank’s asset purchases.\n\n“It would have been nice, from my perspective, had we started at a faster pace,” Plosser said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris, referring to the Fed’s tapering of its stimulus programme. “Given the fact that we’ve embarked on measured reductions, it’s important to give some certainty or at least clarity to the markets on what we’re doing. It’s OK to continue at $10 billion. The hurdle rate for change is pretty high in either direction.”\n\nThe Fed is trying to determine whether the economy has shown recent signs of weakness because of severe winter weather or fundamental obstacles to growth. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 18-19 March in its first gathering led by chair Janet Yellen since she succeeded Ben S. Bernanke last month.\n\nNew York Fed president William C. Dudley said on 7 March he sees a “reasonably favorable” outlook for the economy, even as high unemployment and low inflation warrant stimulus for a “considerable time.”\n\nThe US employers added more workers than projected in February, data last week showed, indicating the economy is starting to bounce back from a weather-induced setback. The 175,000 gain in employment followed a revised 129,000 increase the prior month that was bigger than initially estimated.\n\nNo Whip-Saw\n\nImprovement in the labour market is one reason the FOMC has trimmed monthly bond purchases by $10 billion in each of its past two meetings. The central bank in January reduced monthly bond purchases to $65 billion.\n\nPolicy shouldn’t be “whip-sawed from month to month,” Plosser said when asked about the jobs numbers. The numbers were “encouraging,” though they follow other data in the previous two months that were “weak,” he said.\n\nYellen has pledged to press on with gradual reductions in so-called quantitative easing so long as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.\n\nThe Fed has pledged to keep the main interest rate at zero well past the time unemployment falls below 6.5%. Labour department figures showed that joblessness rose to 6.7% in February from 6.6% the month before as more people entered the labour force and couldn’t find work.\n\nPlosser, a former University of Rochester economist, became president of the Philadelphia Fed in August 2006. The bank’s district includes eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. Bloomberg",

         "Award-winning actress Ruby Dee, best known for her parts in A Raisin in the Sun, American Gangster, and Do the Right Thing, died on Wednesday at the age of 91.\n\nThis article is over 10 years old and may contain outdated information\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAward-winning actress Ruby Dee, best known for her parts in A Raisin in the Sun, American Gangster, and Do the Right Thing, died on Wednesday at the age of 91.\n\nDee might not be immediately recognizable to many contemporary filmgoers, but both her biography and her filmography are impressive ones. She’s acknowledged as a major force in the generation of African-American actors who aspired to greater dramatic roles than those allowed to their forebears. Alongside the likes of Sidney Poitier, Dee appeared in significant film, stage, and television roles across decades, carving a niche for herself and opening the pathway for other African-American stars.\n\nShe appeared opposite Poitier in the film version of A Raisin in the Sun, where they both reprised the roles they originated on stage, and she later appeared opposite Jackie Robinson as his wife in The Jackie Robinson Story. She also received an Oscar nomination for American Gangster, playing Denzel Washington’s mother – a notable nomination, given that Dee only had ten minutes of screentime. She had previously received Emmy nods for her roles in Roots: The Next Generations, and an adaptation of Gore Vidal’s Lincoln.\n\nRuby Dee was also an outspoken Civil Rights activist alongside her husband Ossie Davis, who died in 2005. Both were involved in Martin Luther King’s March on Washington, and in the protests over the Rosenberg Trial. Dee and Davis were recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, described as “one of the most revered couples of the American stage.” The couple was married for 56 years, and had three children.\n\nLike so many actors of her generation, Dee’s death marks the end of era. SAG-AFTRA President Ken Howard released a statement today, saying, “Ruby Dee was truly one of a kind. She was a woman who believed deeply in fairness, a conviction that motivated her lifelong efforts to advance civil rights. The acting community — and the world — is a poorer place for her loss.”\n\nRuby Dee, you will be missed.\n\nWe Got This Covered is supported by our audience.

         "Amazon is the latest internet company to enter the streaming music market, debuting its Prime Music service in the US today.\n\nIt is being bundled into the existing Amazon Prime subscription service rather than launched as a standalone product.\n\nThat means customers paying $99 a year for free shipping, streaming TV and films and Amazon's \"lending library\" of e-books will now also be able to access Prime Music's catalogue of streaming songs.\n\nThe service is advertising-free, with no restrictions on how often individual songs can be played. Prime Music will work on iOS, Android, PC and Mac devices, as well as Amazon's Kindle Fire tablets. Customers will be able to download songs for offline listening too.\n\nPrime Music's catalogue is considerably smaller than rival services, though. Amazon has \"over a million songs\" available at launch in Prime Music. By contrast, Spotify and Deezer both claim to have more than 30m songs available.\n\nIn Amazon's case, the small size of its catalogue may be partly a bet that a more mainstream audience of fans don't mind a smaller pool of music to choose from.\n\nPrime Music is launching with hundreds of \"Prime Playlists\" created by Amazon's editorial team, grouped by genre (Pop, Alternative & Indie Rock) as well as context (Happy & Upbeat, Party Time & Entertaining, Work, Study & Reading etc.)\n\nMany of those playlists offer a \"top songs\" guide to individual artists, from Whitney Houston and Prince to Franz Ferdinand and The Strokes. It's an indication that Amazon sees Prime Music as focused more on back catalogues than current hits.\n\nThat backs up reports in May, when BuzzFeed claimed that the upcoming service \"will not include recent releases but instead restrict its catalog to songs and albums that are six months old and older\".\n\nThis week, the New York Times claimed that Prime Music \"will omit most new releases\" but also suggested that Amazon has only signed licensing deals with two of the three major labels – Sony Music and Warner Music Group – with Universal Music holding out for better terms.\n\nSpotify is the most established rival streaming service, with 40m active users including 10m paying subscribers. The company has been tipped for a stock exchange flotation later in 2014.\n\nOther streaming services that have announced figures include Deezer, which has 16m active users including 5m paying subscribers, and Rhapsody, which has 1.7m paying subscribers across its US service and its Napster subsidiary elsewhere in the world.\n\nBeats Music, which was recently bought by Apple as part of a $3bn acquisition of its parent company Beats Electronics, has 250,000 paying subscribers. Meanwhile, the size of rivals from Microsoft (Xbox Music), Sony (Music Unlimited) and Google (All Access) is unknown.\n\nAmazon's streaming launch comes at a time when the company is embroiled in controversy over its distribution relationships with other entertainment rightsholders.\n\nThe company has halted pre-orders and removed discounts from books by publisher Hachette in the US during a contractual dispute, while also pulling pre-orders for Warner Bros films in a similar row.",

         "Paris/London/Atlanta: Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia president Charles Plosser, who votes on policy this year, said recent encouraging economic data isn’t enough to change the pace of the central bank’s asset purchases.\n\n“It would have been nice, from my perspective, had we started at a faster pace,” Plosser said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris, referring to the Fed’s tapering of its stimulus programme. “Given the fact that we’ve embarked on measured reductions, it’s important to give some certainty or at least clarity to the markets on what we’re doing. It’s OK to continue at $10 billion. The hurdle rate for change is pretty high in either direction.”\n\nThe Fed is trying to determine whether the economy has shown recent signs of weakness because of severe winter weather or fundamental obstacles to growth. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 18-19 March in its first gathering led by chair Janet Yellen since she succeeded Ben S. Bernanke last month.\n\nNew York Fed president William C. Dudley said on 7 March he sees a “reasonably favorable” outlook for the economy, even as high unemployment and low inflation warrant stimulus for a “considerable time.”\n\nThe US employers added more workers than projected in February, data last week showed, indicating the economy is starting to bounce back from a weather-induced setback. The 175,000 gain in employment followed a revised 129,000 increase the prior month that was bigger than initially estimated.\n\nNo Whip-Saw\n\nImprovement in the labour market is one reason the FOMC has trimmed monthly bond purchases by $10 billion in each of its past two meetings. The central bank in January reduced monthly bond purchases to $65 billion.\n\nPolicy shouldn’t be “whip-sawed from month to month,” Plosser said when asked about the jobs numbers. The numbers were “encouraging,” though they follow other data in the previous two months that were “weak,” he said.\n\nYellen has pledged to press on with gradual reductions in so-called quantitative easing so long as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.\n\nThe Fed has pledged to keep the main interest rate at zero well past the time unemployment falls below 6.5%. Labour department figures showed that joblessness rose to 6.7% in February from 6.6% the month before as more people entered the labour force and couldn’t find work.\n\nPlosser, a former University of Rochester economist, became president of the Philadelphia Fed in August 2006. The bank’s district includes eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. Bloomberg",

They've tripled in size. I was a 34A; now I'm a 36C. I'm so excited! I'm telling everyone I know, 'Go ahead, touch them!' Without being an a*****e, I have to say, I love being pregnant.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe 30-year-old star is planning to have a natural birth with Ashton, 36, by her side, but she has already told her beau that he must stay \"above the action\" when their baby girl starts to make her appearance.\n\nShe explained: \"Two people are allowed in my delivery room; my doctor and my significant other. And he [Ashton] is staying above the action. He'll be head to head ... Unless he wants to risk his life and see. But I wouldn't if I were him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the brunette beauty got engaged to Ashton earlier this year and she admits the proposal was the ''best day'' of her life, although she was an emotional wreck.\n\nShe recalled: \"The best day of my life so far was the proposal. I cried. I was a mess.\"",

         "Award-winning actress Ruby Dee, best known for her parts in A Raisin in the Sun, American Gangster, and Do the Right Thing, died on Wednesday at the age of 91.\n\nThis article is over 10 years old and may contain outdated information\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAward-winning actress Ruby Dee, best known for her parts in A Raisin in the Sun, American Gangster, and Do the Right Thing, died on Wednesday at the age of 91.\n\nDee might not be immediately recognizable to many contemporary filmgoers, but both her biography and her filmography are impressive ones. She’s acknowledged as a major force in the generation of African-American actors who aspired to greater dramatic roles than those allowed to their forebears. Alongside the likes of Sidney Poitier, Dee appeared in significant film, stage, and television roles across decades, carving a niche for herself and opening the pathway for other African-American stars.\n\nShe appeared opposite Poitier in the film version of A Raisin in the Sun, where they both reprised the roles they originated on stage, and she later appeared opposite Jackie Robinson as his wife in The Jackie Robinson Story. She also received an Oscar nomination for American Gangster, playing Denzel Washington’s mother – a notable nomination, given that Dee only had ten minutes of screentime. She had previously received Emmy nods for her roles in Roots: The Next Generations, and an adaptation of Gore Vidal’s Lincoln.\n\nRuby Dee was also an outspoken Civil Rights activist alongside her husband Ossie Davis, who died in 2005. Both were involved in Martin Luther King’s March on Washington, and in the protests over the Rosenberg Trial. Dee and Davis were recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, described as “one of the most revered couples of the American stage.” The couple was married for 56 years, and had three children.\n\nLike so many actors of her generation, Dee’s death marks the end of era. SAG-AFTRA President Ken Howard released a statement today, saying, “Ruby Dee was truly one of a kind. She was a woman who believed deeply in fairness, a conviction that motivated her lifelong efforts to advance civil rights. The acting community — and the world — is a poorer place for her loss.”\n\nRuby Dee, you will be missed.\n\nWe Got This Covered is supported by our audience.

         "This movie is about a woman who visits her boyfriend’s parents for the first time. On her way back with her boyfriend, bad weather occurs. This is a movie that requires a hundred percent focus. In the beginning, the narrative of the movie is simple but as you go on, it gets more and more complex. It will leave you with a lot of unanswered questions. It shows how a single event can make you see your entire life. It tries to portray everything we fear such as aging, connection, alienation, and almost everything. The girlfriend is just like every other middle-class white citizen, who tries to hold onto anything such as art, ...",
